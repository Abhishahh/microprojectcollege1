      <h2>Why Nutrition Matters for Students</h2>
      <p>Good nutrition supports study focus, workout recovery, immune function, mood, and long-term health. For students, food choices also influence energy across long study days, the ability to handle stress, and the rate at which training produces results. This page gives practical rules, not fads—so you can eat well on a student budget and still see progress in fitness and wellbeing.</p>

      <h3>Core principles (the simplest checklist)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Whole foods first:</strong> favour vegetables, whole grains, legumes, eggs and dairy (if you eat them).</li>
        <li><strong>Protein at every main meal:</strong> helps recovery and satiety.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables + fibre:</strong> support digestion and steady energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrate:</strong> keep a bottle and sip across the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency beats perfection:</strong> aim for 80% good choices over the week.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Macronutrients — What They Do & Where to Get Them</h2>

      <h3>Protein — The Repair Nutrient</h3>
      <p>Why: Repairs muscle, supports immune function, and increases satiety.</p>
      <p>Student-friendly sources (eggetarian-friendly): eggs, paneer, curd/yogurt, milk, lentils, chickpeas, rajma, tofu, soy products, nuts, seeds. Aim for <strong>1.2–1.6 g per kg of bodyweight</strong> per day if you are regularly active; beginners can use 1.0–1.2 g/kg as a starting point.</p>

      <h3>Carbohydrates — Energy for Brain & Body</h3>
      <p>Why: Primary fuel for study and training. Prefer complex carbs for stable energy: oats, brown rice, millets, whole wheat, potatoes, and fruits.</p>

      <h3>Fats — Hormones & Satiety</h3>
      <p>Why: Support hormones and help absorb fat-soluble vitamins. Use nuts, seeds, avocado, small amounts of oils (olive, mustard), and ghee in moderation.</p>

      <h3>Fibre & Micronutrients</h3>
      <p>Include vegetables, whole grains and fruit to meet fibre and vitamin needs. Special nutrients to watch on vegetarian/eggetarian diets: vitamin B12 (eggs/dairy), iron (lentils, green leafy veg, paired with vitamin C for absorption), calcium (dairy, fortified foods), and vitamin D (sun + supplement if needed).</p>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Calories & Goals — Simple Rules (No complicated math)</h2>
      <p>If your goal is to build muscle, aim for a small calorie surplus (+200–300 kcal/day). If the goal is to lose fat, aim for a small deficit (−300–500 kcal/day). For beginners, a focus on consistent protein and training often leads to body composition improvements without strict calorie counting.</p>

      <h3>Quick calorie estimate (very simple)</h3>
      <p>Use a baseline: <strong>15 kcal × bodyweight (kg)</strong> for a rough maintenance estimate for students with moderate activity. Example: 66 kg × 15 ≈ 990 kcal — this is too low for most; adjust by activity: more active students might need 17–20 kcal × kg. These are rough; for precise work use an online calculator or track intake for 1–2 weeks to see trends.</p>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Practical Meal Planning for Students</h2>
      <p>Meal planning should be time-saving and budget-friendly. The aim is to have repeatable templates, not rigid recipes. Here are templates and a 7-day rotation you can use immediately.</p>

      <h3>Simple Meal Template (Every Meal)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>50% vegetables or salad</li>
        <li>25% protein (eggs, paneer, lentils)</li>
        <li>25% whole grains or starchy carbs (roti, rice, oats, potatoes)</li>
        <li>Small serving of healthy fats (nuts, seeds, oil)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sample Day — Balanced Eggetarian (~2000 kcal)</h3>
      <div class="workout-grid" style="margin-top:12px;">
        <div class="workout-card">
          <h4>Breakfast</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Oats made with milk, sliced banana, a spoon of peanut butter or seeds</li>
            <li>1 boiled egg or small paneer portion</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="workout-card">
          <h4>Lunch</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>2 whole-wheat rotis</li>
            <li>1 cup dal or rajma</li>
            <li>Mixed vegetable sabzi + salad</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="workout-card">
          <h4>Snack & Dinner</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Snack: roasted chana / fruit + handful of nuts</li>
            <li>Dinner: Brown rice + paneer curry or egg curry + salad</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>7-Day Meal Rotation (Detailed, Student-Friendly)</h3>
      <p>This rotation alternates protein sources, spices, and cooking styles to reduce boredom. Make large batches for 2–3 days to save time.</p>

      <div class="workout-grid" style="margin-top:12px;">
        <div class="workout-card">
          <h4>Day 1</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Breakfast: Poha + boiled egg</li>
            <li>Lunch: Rajma + brown rice + salad</li>
            <li>Snacks: Fruit + nuts</li>
            <li>Dinner: Paneer tikka + roti</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="workout-card">
          <h4>Day 2</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Breakfast: Oats + milk + banana</li>
            <li>Lunch: Dal + 2 rotis + mixed veg</li>
            <li>Snack: Yogurt + cucumber</li>
            <li>Dinner: Vegetable pulao + raita</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="workout-card">
          <h4>Day 3</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Breakfast: Smoothie (milk, spinach, banana, peanut butter)</li>
            <li>Lunch: Chickpea salad + roti</li>
            <li>Snack: Roasted chana</li>
            <li>Dinner: Egg curry + rice</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Repeat and swap similar meals through the week. Keep one "treat" meal per week to maintain satisfaction and adherence.</p>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Meal Prep & Time-Saving Strategies</h2>
      <p>Meal prep is the friend of busy students. Here are practical tips to save time and money without compromising nutrition.</p>

      <h3>Batch Cooking Basics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cook a large pot of dal/chana/rajma and portion into containers.</li>
        <li>Cook rice or millet in larger batches and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Roast mixed vegetables and use them across meals (wraps, bowls).</li>
        <li>Boil 6–8 eggs at once for quick protein.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5-Minute Meals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Egg bhurji + toast + salad</li>
        <li>Greek yogurt + fruit + seeds</li>
        <li>Paneer sandwich with veggies</li>
        <li>Microwave baked potato + curd + chana salad</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Storage & Food Safety</h3>
      <p>Cool cooked food before storing, use airtight containers, and consume within 3–4 days for home-prepped meals. Reheat fully before eating.</p>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Protein Math — How Much Protein Do You Really Need?</h2>
      <p>Many students ask: "How much protein should I eat?" Here is a practical way to calculate and meet targets.</p>

      <h3>Step 1 — Choose your target</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sedentary — 0.8–1.0 g/kg</li>
        <li>Active / Strength focus — 1.2–1.6 g/kg</li>
        <li>Aggressive muscle gain — 1.6–2.0 g/kg (usually not necessary for most students)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2 — Calculate</h3>
      <p>Example: If you are 66 kg and active: 66 × 1.4 ≈ 92 g protein/day. Spread roughly evenly across meals: ~30 g at breakfast, 30 g at lunch, 30 g at dinner (plus snacks).</p>

      <h3>Easy protein portions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 boiled egg ≈ 6–7 g protein</li>
        <li>100 g paneer ≈ 14–18 g protein</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked dal ≈ 8–10 g protein</li>
        <li>1 cup Greek yogurt ≈ 8–12 g protein</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked chickpeas ≈ 14–15 g protein</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Budget-Friendly Shopping List</h2>
      <p>Shopping smart saves money and ensures you can follow healthy meals. Buy staples in bulk and seasonal produce where possible.</p>

      <table class="nutrition-table" style="margin-top:12px;">

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Pre & Post Workout Nutrition (Simple Rules)</h2>
      <h3>Pre-workout (30–60 minutes)</h3>
      <p>Small carb + small protein: banana + peanut butter, toast + egg, or a small yogurt with fruit. Avoid heavy, greasy meals within 1–2 hours of training.</p>

      <h3>Post-workout (within 60–90 minutes)</h3>
      <p>Protein + carbs to support recovery: milk + banana, dal + rice, paneer sandwich, or Greek yogurt + fruit.</p>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Supplements — What Students Should Know</h2>
      <p>Supplements are optional. Prioritise whole foods first. If you consider supplements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Protein powder (whey or plant):</strong> convenient when daily protein is hard to meet; not mandatory.</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> many people are deficient; consider testing and supplementing if low.</li>
        <li><strong>Multivitamin:</strong> can help if diet is poor, but not a substitute for whole foods.</li>
        <li><strong>Creatine:</strong> well-researched and safe for most young adults if taken appropriately; benefits strength gains in resistance training. Consider consulting a coach or professional if unsure.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="small">Always check local rules and consult a healthcare professional before starting supplements, especially for under-18s or if you have health conditions.</p>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Special Considerations & Common Student Problems</h2>

      <h3>1. Lack of Appetite (Exam Stress)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Try smaller, frequent meals and nutrient-dense options (smoothies, nuts, milkshakes).</li>
        <li>Use liquid calories wisely: milk + banana smoothies can pack calories and protein.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Late Night Eating</h3>
      <p>If you must eat late, choose light options: yogurt, fruit, or a small sandwich. Avoid heavy fried foods that disrupt sleep.</p>

      <h3>3. Vegetarian Protein Concerns</h3>
      <p>Combine pulses and grains across the day (rice + dal, roti + chana) to get a variety of amino acids. Use eggs and dairy if you eat them — they are high-quality protein sources.</p>

      <h3>4. Dining Hall / Mess Food</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose dal/vegetable curries and roti over too many fried options.</li>
        <li>Use salad and curd to add fibre and protein.</li>
        <li>Bring a boiled egg or small container of yogurt if allowed to supplement meals.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>How to Track Progress Without Obsession</h2>
      <p>Tracking helps you learn what changes work. Use a simple weekly log:</p>
      <pre style="background:#f8f9fa; padding:12px; border-radius:8px;">
Week | Avg Sleep (hrs) | Avg Water (L) | Days Trained | Protein/day (g) | Weight | Notes
1    | 7.0             | 2.0           | 3            | 85              | 66kg   | Felt energetic
      </pre>
      <p>Look at trends over weeks, not daily fluctuations. Small consistent changes are the goal.</p>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Food Safety & Hygiene for Student Kitchens</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash hands & vegetables thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Store cooked food within 2 hours of cooking; refrigerate in airtight boxes.</li>
        <li>Reheat to steaming hot before eating.</li>
        <li>Label containers by date to avoid eating old food.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Example 2-Week Meal Plan (Printable & Repeatable)</h2>
      <p>Below is a compact, student-friendly two-week template you can copy into a planner. Each day has breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner with interchangeable items.</p>

      <div class="workout-grid" style="margin-top:12px;">

      <h2>Nutrition Myths — Quick Debunk</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Carbs make you fat. <strong>Fact:</strong> Excess total calories cause weight gain; carbs are essential for energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Protein powders are necessary. <strong>Fact:</strong> They are convenient but not required if you meet protein via food.</li>
        <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Skipping meals helps lose weight. <strong>Fact:</strong> It can lead to energy crashes and poor food choices later.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin:24px 0;">

      <h2>Final Practical Checklist — Use This Daily</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Drink one full glass of water on waking.</li>
        <li>Include a protein source at breakfast.</li>
        <li>Pack or plan one healthy snack.</li>
        <li>Include vegetables with at least two meals.</li>
        <li>Sleep 7+ hours on most nights.</li>
      </ol>
