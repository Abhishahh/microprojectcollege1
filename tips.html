      <h2>Why Wellness Matters for Students</h2>
      <p>Wellness is the foundation on which study performance, social life, and physical health are built. Students who pay attention to sleep, stress management, movement, and simple routines perform better academically and feel better day-to-day. This page focuses on fast, repeatable practices you can adopt immediately — no expensive apps, no long retreats, just useful tools for real life.</p>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>1. Stress Management — Practical Techniques that Work</h2>
      <p>Stress is a normal response to challenges. Short-term stress helps us focus. The problem is chronic stress — prolonged activation of stress systems undermines sleep, appetite, focus, and immune function. Here are practical, short tools you can use anywhere.</p>

      <h3>Breathing Exercises (2–6 minutes)</h3>
      <p>Breathing is the fastest way to influence the nervous system. Use these when you feel tense or before an exam.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>4-4-4 breathing:</strong> Inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s — repeat 4–6 cycles.</li>
        <li><strong>Box breathing:</strong> Inhale 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s, hold 4s — repeat 3–5 cycles.</li>
        <li><strong>Diaphragmatic breathing:</strong> Place one hand on chest and one on belly; breathe slowly into the belly for 5 minutes (inhale 4s, exhale 6s).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Grounding & Sensory Techniques</h3>
      <p>When anxiety spikes, use grounding to reconnect with the present moment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5–4–3–2–1: name 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, 1 thing you taste (or a positive memory).</li>
        <li>Cold water splash or holding ice for 10–20 seconds can quickly lower arousal (use sensibly).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mini-Timeouts</h3>
      <p>Short timeouts (2–10 minutes) are powerful tools: step outside, walk for 5 minutes, do a 3-minute breathing set, or make a hot drink. These resets break cycles of rumination and restore clarity.</p>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>2. Sleep Hygiene — Real Steps for Better Sleep</h2>
      <p>Sleep supports memory consolidation, mood regulation, immune function, and physical recovery. Students often sacrifice sleep to study — short-term gain, long-term loss. Use these practical steps to improve sleep quality.</p>

      <h3>Consistent Schedule</h3>
      <p>Aim to go to bed and wake up within a 60-minute window every day, including weekends when possible. A consistent rhythm strengthens your circadian system and makes sleep easier.</p>

      <h3>Wind-down Routine (30–60 minutes)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dim lights and reduce blue light exposure from screens.</li>
        <li>Read a physical book, practice light stretching, or journal (5–10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Avoid heavy meals, spicy food, or intense workouts within 60–90 minutes of sleep.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep your room cool (18–22°C) if possible.</li>
        <li>Make it dark (curtains or eye mask) and quiet (earplugs if needed).</li>
        <li>Use the bed for sleep and intimacy only — avoid studying in bed to strengthen sleep association.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sleep Tools for Students</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Short naps (20–30 minutes) can boost alertness without disrupting nighttime sleep.</li>
        <li>Limit caffeine after mid-afternoon (around 2 PM).</li>
        <li>If you can’t fall asleep in 20 minutes, get up and do a relaxing activity until you feel sleepy.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>3. Mindfulness & Mental Clarity — Tiny Practices, Big Effects</h2>
      <p>Mindfulness builds focus and reduces reactivity. You don’t need long meditation sessions; short practices are highly effective for students.</p>

      <h3>Micro-Meditations (3–10 minutes)</h3>
      <p>Simple guided micro-meditations: focus on breath, or do a body scan (notice sensations head-to-toe). Apps help, but a timer and quiet corner work fine.</p>

      <h3>Mindful Study (Pomodoro + Pause)</h3>
      <p>Use a study rhythm like 45min focus / 15min break. During the break, practice a 2-minute breathing exercise or a 5-minute walk. This balances focus with recovery and prevents burnout.</p>

      <h3>Mindful Eating</h3>
      <p>Once per day, eat a meal without screens for 10–15 minutes. Notice flavors, textures, and fullness cues. This small practice improves digestion and reduces rushed, unhealthy choices.</p>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>4. Movement for Mood — Short Routines to Boost Energy</h2>
      <p>Movement improves mood through endorphins and better blood flow. You don’t need hours — short bouts help a lot.</p>

      <h3>5-Minute Desk Mobility</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Neck rolls — 6 each direction</li>
        <li>Shoulder rolls — 10 forward, 10 back</li>
        <li>Seated cat-cow — 8 reps</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>10-Minute Energy Circuit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 minute marching in place</li>
        <li>30 seconds squats</li>
        <li>30 seconds push-up incline</li>
        <li>30 seconds jumping jacks</li>
        <li>Repeat once</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Walking & Nature</h3>
      <p>Short walks (10–20 minutes) outdoors improve mood and attention via fresh air and light exposure. If possible, take a 15-minute walk during a study break.</p>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>5. Habit Design — Build Wellness into Your Day</h2>
      <p>Good intentions only go so far. Design your environment so healthy choices are easy and automatic.</p>

      <h3>Habit Stacking</h3>
      <p>Attach a new wellness habit to an existing one. Example: After brushing your teeth (existing), do 3 minutes of stretching (new). This reduces friction and increases adherence.</p>

      <h3>Make It Obvious, Make It Easy, Make It Satisfying</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Obvious:</strong> leave a water bottle on your desk</li>
        <li><strong>Easy:</strong> have 5-minute routines available in a note on your phone</li>
        <li><strong>Satisfying:</strong> mark your habit on a calendar or reward yourself after 7 consistent days</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tracking Without Obsession</h3>
      <p>Track 1–3 metrics only: days trained, hours slept (weekly average), and number of mindful sessions. Use a small notebook or a simple spreadsheet to check weekly progress.</p>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>6. Time Management & Work-Life Balance</h2>
      <p>Time pressure is a major driver of stress. Practical time structures foster calm and productivity.</p>

      <h3>Time Blocking</h3>
      <p>Divide your day into blocks: study, meals, movement, relaxation, social time. Even 30-minute blocks give structure and reduce decision fatigue.</p>

      <h3>Prioritization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>List 3 MITs (Most Important Tasks) each day.</li>
        <li>Start the day with the toughest MIT when your energy is highest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Boundaries & Rest</h3>
      <p>Set a hard stop on late-night study 1 hour before bed during heavy weeks. Schedule buffer time after intense study sessions to move or relax briefly.</p>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>7. Social Wellness — Keeping Healthy Relationships</h2>
      <p>Strong social ties protect mental health. Invest time in small, meaningful interactions rather than many surface-level connections.</p>

      <h3>Micro-Connections</h3>
      <p>Send a short “How are you?” message or meet a friend for a 20-minute walk. These small actions build long-term support.</p>

      <h3>Healthy Boundaries</h3>
      <p>Learning to say “no” to activities you can’t manage is essential for long-term balance. Saying no respectfully protects your time and energy.</p>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>8. Nutrition for Mental Health</h2>
      <p>Food impacts mood, concentration, and energy. Use the Nutrition page for full guidance, but here are quick rules you can implement today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a protein-containing breakfast to stabilise energy.</li>
        <li>Aim for whole-food carbohydrates and include vegetables.</li>
        <li>Stay hydrated — dehydration worsens concentration and mood.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>9. Ergonomics & Study Posture</h2>
      <p>Long hours at a desk can cause neck, shoulder and back pain. Address posture and setup to protect your body and concentration.</p>

      <h3>Quick Setup Checklist</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Screen at eye level (raise laptop with books or a stand)</li>
        <li>Feet flat on the floor; knees at ~90°</li>
        <li>Use a chair with back support or place a small cushion for lumbar support</li>
        <li>Take a 2-minute movement break every 30–45 minutes</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Micro-Exercises for Desk Users</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Neck retractions — 8 reps</li>
        <li>Scapular squeezes — 12 reps</li>
        <li>Hip flexor stretch — 30s each side</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>10. Crisis & When to Seek Help</h2>
      <p>Wellness tips are not a replacement for professional help. If you experience persistent low mood, severe anxiety, suicidal thoughts, or functional impairment, seek help immediately. Use campus counseling, local hotlines, or trusted adults. Asking for help is a sign of strength.</p>

      <p class="small">If you are outside your campus or unsure where to go, contact emergency services or a trusted family member while arranging professional help.</p>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>12. Quick Micro-Practices You Can Do Anywhere</h2>
      <p>Keep these small practices handy — they are low-effort and high-impact over time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>60-second grounder:</strong> breathe deeply and list 3 things you can hear.</li>
        <li><strong>2-minute stretch:</strong> neck rolls + shoulder stretches + forward fold.</li>
        <li><strong>5-minute gratitude:</strong> write three small things that went well today.</li>
        <li><strong>10-minute walk:</strong> leave your phone at home and notice the environment.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>13. Troubleshooting — Common Student Barriers & Fixes</h2>

      <h3>Barrier: No time</h3>
      <p>Fix: Choose micro-practices and integrate them into existing routines (habit stacking). Short 10–12 minute sessions preserve continuity.</p>

      <h3>Barrier: Low motivation</h3>
      <p>Fix: Use accountability — a friend or study group. Track small wins and rethink the activity to be more enjoyable (music, outdoor walk).</p>

      <h3>Barrier: Overwhelm during exams</h3>
      <p>Fix: Prioritise sleep and micro-breaks. Short walks and breathing exercises reduce cognitive overload better than extra study hours without rest.</p>

      <hr style="margin:28px 0;">

      <h2>15. Final Encouragement</h2>
      <p>Wellness is not a destination; it is a set of daily practices that compound over time. Start with one small habit, build it for one week, then add another. Over months, these small practices lead to meaningful improvements in mood, focus, and physical resilience. You’re not expected to be perfect — just consistent.</p>
